# Travel Agency Site

Hi! This is a project developed with the intention to **teach** people, I've recorder my screen during the entire development and uploaded the videos in my [youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpn2SSYNsR8&list=PLOUrDmh7c7mVzTETBVBerrMawaLd-4RMs).

The main goals here were to teach the basics of HTML and CSS so that students could create their own portfolios.

Nice things that could be learned from this project:
 - Flexbox concepts
	-	We covered the basics of flexbox, like: flex-direction, justify-content and align-items
 - How to integrate with google maps
	 - The site contact section uses a map to show the address, for that we used google maps integration and documentation.
 - Media queries
	 - All the site is responsive for smartphones, tablets and desktops.
